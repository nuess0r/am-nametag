HELLO! My Name Is LED Nametag Kit
=================================

Your name in lights! Spell out up to 5 characters


Project description: [Analog Machines Nametag](http://analogmachines.com/p/nametag)


With the HELLO! My Name Is LED Nametag Kit you can stand out from the crowd, 
instead of scrawling your name on the ubiquitous "Hello, My Name Is:" stickers.
Next time you're at a meet and greet party at your local hackerspace, there 
will be no mistaking that you are a maker.

The nametag kit is a perfect first or second soldering project and is the 
greatest alternative to stick on name tags that we've ever seen.


It comes with 4 built-in programs: all on, letter chase, fade, and blink. 
There's also a power saving mode.

As part of the project, we've developed a simple [font and a name layout tool]
(http://analogmachines.com/p/nametag/name.html). 
Right now, our font only supports 5 letters or less. 
Check it out and see how your name will look!
